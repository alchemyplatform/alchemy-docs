description: >-
  Returns the currently configured chain ID, a value used in replay-protected
  transaction signing as introduced by EIP-155.

# eth\_chainId

The chain ID returned should always correspond to the information in the current known head block. This ensures that caller of this RPC method can always use the retrieved information to sign transactions built on top of the head.

If the current known head block does not specify a chain ID, the client should treat any calls to `eth_chainId` as though the method were not supported, and return a suitable error.

You should prefer `eth_chainId` over `net_version`, so that you can reliably identify the chain you are communicating with.

### **Parameters**

None.

### **Returns**

`QUANTITY` - integer of the current chain ID.

### **Example**
