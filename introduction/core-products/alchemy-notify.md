### 2. :heavy_check_mark: Easy Integration

### 3. :mag_right: Rich Developer Insights

## :tired_face: Problem: Notifications don't exist in blockchain

* UX and lack of relevant notifications is one of the biggest inhibitors to the growth of blockchain apps.
* Getting the information required to notify users about web3 events is complicated and requires large amounts of dev time and extra infrastructure. 
* Itâ€™s impossible for developers to trigger notifications for important events like dropped transactions.

## :smiley: Solution: Alchemy Notify 

Alchemy Notify enables you to send relevant, timely notifications on the most important Web3 events with the following benefits:

* Starts working with a two-click creation process, doing all the hard work for you. 
* Has built in notifications for mined transactions, dropped transactions and smart contract events.  

## Features 

### :pick: [Mined Transactions ](../../guides/using-notify.md#mined-transactions)

Let your users know exactly when their deposits, purchases, in-game actions or other on-chain activity has officially occurred â€” the perfect time to re-engage and keep using your application.

### :hole: [Dropped Transactions](../../guides/using-notify.md#dropped-transactions)

Let your users respond immediately when transactions fail, eliminating the most frustrating part of blockchain UX. No more missed trades, lost auctions, or disappearing tokens.

### :money_with_wings: [Address Activity](../../guides/using-notify.md#address-activity)

Let your users know when transaction activity occurs on their address. No more refreshing the page or having to watch each new block and create custom filters to track userâ€™s data. The Address Activity webhooks include notifications for:

1. [External Transfers](../../guides/using-notify.md#types-of-transfers)
2. [Internal Transfers](../../guides/using-notify.md#types-of-transfers)
3. [Token Transfers](../../guides/using-notify.md#address-activity)

### :fuelpump:[ Gas Price](../../guides/using-notify.md#4-gas-price) <a href="address-activity" id="address-activity"></a>

The Gas Price Webhook allows you to receive a notification every minute when the Mainnet gas price rises above or drops below a certain threshold that you can select.
