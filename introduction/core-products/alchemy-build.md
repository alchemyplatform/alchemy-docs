## Benefits 

### 1. :woman_technologist: Build Faster

Release products faster and save engineering time. 

### 2. :lady_beetle: Debug

Debug new things that were not possible before. 

### 3. :sunglasses: Enhanced Customer Experience 

Resolve customer issues faster, creating a better experience for end users. 

## :tired_face:Problem: Debugging is difficult

* Good tools for debugging customer issues in blockchain do not exist like they do for modern web and mobile development. 
* Blockchain developers spend days of engineering time to debug simple problems. 
* Much of the data that is necessary for debugging is not accessible by developers, and if it is, there are no tools to search or filter results.
* Debugging issues inevitably results in product downtime for users when they run into bugs.  

## :smiley: Solution: Alchemy Build

Alchemy Build lets you easily investigate bugs in your blockchain product with the following benefits: 

* Search through millions of your historical requests in milliseconds.
* Gives you clear, filterable, human-readable access to all of your productâ€™s activity.
* Provides specific tools for diagnosing and solving super complex issues like Mempool errors. 
* Lets you quickly prototype and fix failing requests with immediate UI feedback, so you can ship fixes to your customers faster.

## Features

### :mag_right: Explorer

Instantly search through millions of historical requests to find specific bugs, performance optimizations, or patterns of errors.
