## :clipboard: Steps to get started with Alchemy

This guide assumes you already have an [Alchemy account](https://alchemy.com/?r=e68b2f77-7fc7-4ef7-8e9c-cdfea869b9b5) and access to our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io).

**1**. :key: Create an Alchemy key

**2**. :writing\_hand: Make a request

**3**. :handshake: Set up Alchemy as your client

4\. :computer: Start building!

## 1. :key: Create an Alchemy Key

To use Alchemy's products, you need an API key to authenticate your requests.

You can [create API keys from the dashboard](http://dashboard.alchemyapi.io). Check out this video on how to create an app:

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfggWxfG9o0" %}

Or follow the written steps below:

First navigate to the "create app" button in the "Apps" tab.&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-11-01-at-6.53.45-pm.png)

Fill in the details under "Create App" to get your new key. You can also see apps you previously made and those made by your team here. Pull existing keys by clicking on "View Key" for any app.

![](../.gitbook/assets/create-app-details.png)

You can also pull existing API keys by hovering over "Apps" and selecting one. You can "View Key" here, as well as "Edit App" to whitelist specific domains, see several developer tools, and view analytics.

## 2. :writing\_hand: Make a Request&#x20;

You can interact with Alchemy's Ethereum infrastructure provider using JSON-RPC and your [command line](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandi.htm).

For manual requests, we recommend interacting with the `JSON-RPC` via `POST` requests. Simply pass in the `Content-Type: application/json` header and your query as the `POST` body with the following fields:

* `jsonrpc`: The JSON-RPC versionâ€”currently, only `2.0` is supported.
* `method`: The ETH API method. [See API reference.](../apis/ethereum/)
* `params`: A list of parameters to pass to the method.
* `id`: The ID of your request. Will be returned by the response so you can keep track of which request a response belongs to.

Here is an example you can run from the Terminal/Windows/LINUX command line to retrieve the current gas price:

```bash
curl https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/demo \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_gasPrice","params":[],"id":73}'
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Want to send requests to your own app instead of our public demo?

Replace [https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/demo](https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/jsonrpc/demo) with your own API key [https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key](https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/jsonrpc/your-api-key).
{% endhint %}

Results:

```javascript
{ "id": 73,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "0x09184e72a000" // 10000000000000 }
```

## 3. :handshake: Set up Alchemy as your Client &#x20;

Below you will find how to set up or switch your current provider to Alchemy for Alchemy Web3, Web3.js, Web3.py, Web3j, and Ether.js. . &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If you have an existing client,** change your current node provider URL to an Alchemy URL with your API key: "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key"

**Note:** The scripts below need to be run in a **node context** or **saved in a file**, not run from the command line.
{% endhint %}

### Alchemy Web3

There are tons of Web3 libraries you can integrate with Alchemy, however, we recommend using [Alchemy Web3](notion://www.notion.so/alchemy/documentation/alchemy-web3), a drop-in replacement for web3.js, built and configured to work seamlessly with Alchemy. This provides multiple advantages such as automatic retries and robust WebSocket support.

To install AlchemyWeb3.js, you want to create a project, and then navigate to your project directory to run the installation. Let's go ahead and do that! Once we're in our home directory, let's execute the following:

With Yarn:

```bash
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name
yarn add @alch/alchemy-web3
```

With NPM:

```bash
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm init   # (or npm init --yes)
npm install @alch/alchemy-web3
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You might get warnings/errors, but no need to worry about them â€” they're harmless!
{% endhint %}

To interact with Alchemy's node infrastructure, let's go ahead and send a request!

### 1. From your [command line](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandi.htm), create a new project directory and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir web3-example
cd web3-example
```

### 2. Install the Alchemy Web3 dependency if you have not already:

You can use any [web3 library](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/introduction/getting-started#other-web3-libraries) of your choosing, however there are tons of benefits to using [Alchemy Web3](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/documentation/alchemy-web3)!

```bash
npm install @alch/alchemy-web3
```

### 3. Create a file named `index.js` and add the following contents:

Hint: You should ultimately replace `<api-key>` with your Alchemy HTTP API key.

```javascript
async function main() {
 const { createAlchemyWeb3 } = require("@alch/alchemy-web3");
 const web3 = createAlchemyWeb3("https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<api-key>");
 const blockNumber = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber();
 console.log("The latest block number is " + blockNumber);
}
main();
```

Unfamiliar with the async stuff? Check out this [Medium post](https://medium.com/better-programming/understanding-async-await-in-javascript-1d81bb079b2c).

### 4. Run it using node

```bash
node index.js
```

### 5. You should now see the latest block number output in your console!

```bash
The latest block number is 11043912
```

Woo! Congrats! You just wrote your first web3 script using Alchemy and sent your first request your Alchemy API endpoint ðŸŽ‰

The project associated with your API key should now look like this on the dashboard:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/alchemy-tutorial-result2 (1).png>)

### Other Web3 Libraries

To use the any of the libraries below, you will need to install web3 first with `npm install web3` . Once you've installed web3, add any one of the below code snippets to a new JavaScript, Python, or Java file (depending on which library you choose).&#x20;

Check out the documentation for each library:

* [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/)
* [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Web3j](https://docs.web3j.io)
* [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)&#x20;

Now you can add any one of the below code snippets to your new file depending on your respective library!

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Web3.js" %}
```javascript
// JavaScript: web3.js
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3("https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key");
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Web3.py" %}
```python
# Python: web3.py
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key"));
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Web3j" %}
```java
// Java: web3j
Web3j web3 = Web3j.build(new HttpService("https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key"));
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ethers.js" %}
```javascript
// Ethers.js
const url = "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key";
const customHttpProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(url);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 4. :computer: Start Building!

Don't know where to start? Check out these four tutorials to get more familiar with Alchemy and blockchain development:

1. Test out your dashboard knowledge with the [Dashboard Demo App](../guides/demo-app.md)
2. Write a [simple web3 script](../tutorials/simple-web3-script.md) that gets the latest block number
3. Learn how to send an [Ethereum transaction](../tutorials/sending-txs.md) using Web3 and Alchemy
4. Try deploying your first [smart contract ](../tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/)and get your hands dirty with some solidity programming

Once you complete this tutorial, let us know how your experience was or if you have any feedback by tagging us on Twitter [@alchemyplatform](https://twitter.com/AlchemyPlatform)!
