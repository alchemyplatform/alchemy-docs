## :mega: Calling all Ethereum developers...

Whether you are using Ethereum for the first time, working on a solo project, or working for the largest teams in the space, Alchemy is here to make your life as an Ethereum developer exponentially better.

## :calling: Want to build a dApp? You're going to need nodes...

With the current blockchain landscape, maintaining self-hosted nodes is expensive, unreliable, and extremely time-consuming. Alchemy gives you access to our custom [Supernode](core-products/alchemy-supernode.md) API that is built for production, requires only 1-minute to integrate, and has 100% data correctness. We also provide an additional suite of developer tools to make your life as a blockchain developer even easier.

## :thumbsdown: The Downside of Self-Hosted Nodes

Running and maintaining self-hosted nodes can be a blockchain developer's #1 pain.&#x20;

#### It's expensive:

* An average of $86k/year in costs
* $2k-5k/month in AWS costs
* $4800/month of engineering time

#### It's time consuming:

* Teams waste 25% of engineering resources managing nodes
* It takes 3-6 months to develop robust infrastructure
* Failures can be catastrophic, requiring up to 3 weeks to recover

#### It can be unreliable:

* Nodes on average have issues once every 5 days:
  * CPU spikes, memory leaks, disk issues&#x20;
  * Inconsistent peering&#x20;
  * Corrupted internal databases&#x20;
  * Transaction broadcasting issues&#x20;
  * Frequent bugs + regressions
  * 1 in 6 “stable releases” are broken&#x20;

Trust us, you don't want to be doing this.&#x20;

## :sunglasses: Leave Node Hosting to the Experts

Alchemy's core products are here to eliminate the pains of self-hosting nodes, in addition to providing world-class developer tools.&#x20;
