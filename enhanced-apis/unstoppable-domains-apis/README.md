# Unstoppable Domains APIs

## Introduction

The Unstoppable Resolution Service API provides the functionalities for getting domain data and metadata regardless of that domain’s location, whether it is stored on Ethereum, Zilliqa, Polygon, or any other blockchain. The API is used to cache blockchain events in a database for easy retrieval without accessing blockchain APIs.

With the API, you can quickly build applications that directly communicate with the blockchain to get Unstoppable domain data with a single API request.

Unstoppable Domains also provides a set of libraries to ease the integration of domain resolution into your applications. Please see the [Resolution Libraries Overview](https://docs.unstoppabledomains.com/developer-toolkit/resolution-libraries/libraries-overview/) for a detailed description and configuration.
